        I am freshman at Harvey Mudd College. Although I have not declared a major,
        I am interested in engineering, computer science, and biology-chemistry. At 
        Mudd, I have a job on campus as a sports medicine aid for Claremont-Mudd-Scripps
        Athletics. I also work as a virtual tutor for Comprehensive College Prep and as
        a Seasonal Recreation Leader for the City of Dana Point. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although school and work take up most of my time, I like to relax by playing 
        intramural soccer and football with my friends. I also enjoy writing songs and
        playing my guitar, as seen through my music portfolio tab above!
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, I think that's enough of an intro. Welcome to my website! I hope you enjoy exploring my
        coding and STEM related projects!
